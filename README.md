# SharedResources for [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/)

This are just shared resources across my mods, it is not fully a mod since each of my mods contains a version of it, currently it will just be ignored. With a later on version of the mod loader it might be able to just load the latest version by itself
- Built for the [GodotModLoader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader)
